The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework 
used to understand network communications. 

It has 7 layers organized from the lowest to the highest:

1. Physical - transmits raw bits over a medium (cables, radio, etc.)
2. Data Link - reliable transmission of frames between nodes
3. Network - routing of packets (IP, ICMP)
4. Transport - end-to-end communication (TCP, UDP)
5. Session - manages sessions between applications
6. Presentation - translates data for applications (encryption, encoding)
7. Application - high-level protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP
